# Fitness Buddy – AI-Powered Virtual Health Coach  
This repository contains the final presentation for my IBM SkillBuild Capstone Project titled “Fitness Buddy” – an AI-based fitness and wellness assistant built using Watsonx.ai on IBM Cloud.

## Project Overview  
In today’s fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be challenging due to time constraints, lack of guidance, and motivation. Fitness Buddy addresses this problem by acting as a virtual AI health coach that provides:  

- Personalized workout plans  
- Nutritional meal suggestions  
- Motivational tips  
- Habit-building support  

The assistant is implemented using a no-code, prompt-based setup in Watsonx.ai, utilizing IBM’s granite-3-3-8b-instruct foundation model and external tools like Google Search and Wikipedia to provide intelligent, up-to-date recommendations.

## Technologies Used  
- IBM Watsonx.ai  
- IBM Cloud Lite  
- Foundation Model: granite-3-3-8b-instruct  
- External Tools:  
  - Google Search  
  - Wikipedia Search
  - Weather Tool  

## System Approach  
- No-code interface for building and testing the agent  
- Prompt engineering for controlling assistant behavior  
- Modular setup for tool invocation and response generation
